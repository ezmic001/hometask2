PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This task involves defining a Car class with attributes such as id, Make, Model, Year of manufacture, Color, Price, and Registration number. The task also includes an array of Car objects to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts and array manipulation in Java.

Development Environment:
- Programming Language: Java 
- Integrated Development Environment: Eclipse 
- JDK Version: Java SE 8 (1.8.0_421)
- Operating System: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Key Features:
1. Car class:
- Attributes: id (int), make (String), model (String), yearOfManufacture (int), color (String), price (double), registrationNumber (String)
- Constructor: Parameterized constructor to initialize the attributes
- Methods: A toString method for displaying car details

2. Array of Car Objects:
- Create an array to store multiple Car objects

Expected Outcome:
By the end of this project, I have a solid understanding of how to create and manipulate objects in Java, as well as how to work with arrays of objects. This project also enhances my skills in using an IDE and managing a Java development environment.
